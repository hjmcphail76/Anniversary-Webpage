            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I am enrolled at Emerald High School, where I am currently #1 in my class. I am on swim team, tennis
                team, and First Robotics Competition (FRC) team 8575. I have technical tendencies, love to tinker and am
                a good logical problem solver. I have a passion for learning new skills with a wide range from computer
                science, CNC, 3D printing, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and shop fabrication. I
                strongly
                believe it is important to have a wide range of skills to bring to the table, especially since they all
                interconnect in one way or another. <br> I have been apart of the FIRST program since I was six years
                old,
                and have moved up through the diffrent programs to now the highschool FRC team. Robotics and technology
                has
                always been my passion.</p>
